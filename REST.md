# REST

A RESTful **API** is an architectural style for an application program interface **(API)** that uses **HTTP requests** to access and use data. That data can be used to `GET`, `PUT`, `POST` and `DELETE` data types, which refers to the _reading, updating, creating and deleting_ of operations concerning resources.

An **API** for a website is code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other. The **API** spells out the proper way for a developer to write a program requesting services from an operating system or other application.

A **RESTful API** -- also referred to as a RESTful web service or REST **API** -- is based on representational state transfer **(REST)**, which is an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.

REST technology is generally preferred over other similar technologies. This tends to be the case because **REST** uses less bandwidth, making it more suitable for efficient internet usage. RESTful APIs can also be built with programming languages such as JavaScript or Python.
